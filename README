:::  Install instructions :::

:: Maven ::

 - Set env variable WTK-home to the root location of your installed sun wireless toolkit
 - you may have to add jsr234 to the maven repo manually
 - build: mvn clean install
 - jar located in /target

::ANT ::

Preperation:
 - If you use the WTK version 3 or later, uncomment the library specifications in javame/build.xml and comment the 2.5.x packages. Look for the "These are used with WTK..."-messages.
 - modify the build.properties file, uncomment and...
   * Set the proguard path to the proguard.jar file (include the whole path with the file-name)
   * Set the root path to the WTK.
 
Building and setting up dev environment (Eclipse)
- Create a new workspace at javame-improved root
- Import the projects in eclipse by going:
  * New -> Project... -> Java project form existing ant file
  * find the core project, select build.xml and click finish. Repeat for javame.
- Change JDK compliance to 1.3
  * Window -> Java -> Compiler -> Compiler compliance level -> 1.3
  * Hit apply, and refresh workspace
- Build the core project. Right click build.xml -> run as -> ant build
- Build javame with same procedure
- Eclipse wil probably report errors. Troubleshooting: Try building after each step until it successfully builds
  * Add core.jar from the core package in build path
  * Add java system library to the build path
  * Remove JRE_LIB from build path

Building in terminal (from zxing):
- Make sure you are running the compiler in compability mode with version 1.4 or lower
- Build the core first: ant -f core/build.xml
- Then build javame: ant -f javase/build.xml

Deploying
- Copy Barcode.jar and .jad to mobile device
